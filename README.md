# The Bitcoin Dev Project

This is the source code for the [Bitcoin Dev Project](https://bitcoindevs.xyz) that we hope will serve as a go-to place for aspiring bitcoin developers to learn about the many curriculums and programs that exist.

## Setup

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your local machine.
2. To serve the website, run the command `jekyll serve -l`.

## Development with Live Reloading

The Bitcoin Dev Project uses Gulp for live reloading and development. To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Run the command `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. Run the command `gulp build` to build the project.
3. Finally, run the command `jekyll serve` to start the development server.

With these steps, you will have the development environment set up with live reloading enabled. Any changes made to the project will be automatically reflected in the browser, making the development process faster and more efficient.
